# Reflection Report – Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & EduCourses Project

## Project Overview
This project was created as part of the **Internship Task – Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Page Design**.  
I developed an educational course website named **EduCourses** using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5**, designed to be **modern, clean, and fully responsive**.

The website consists of three main pages — **Home**, **About**, and **Contact** — each demonstrating Bootstrap layout designs and component integration.

## Steps I Followed

1. **Project Setup**
   - Created required files: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `style.css`.
   - Used **Bootstrap 5 CDN** to include styling and responsive utilities.

2. **Component Exploration**
   - Explored Bootstrap documentation and examples to understand UI patterns.
   - Selected UI components including **Navbar, Cards, Carousel, Badges, and Forms**.

3. **Home Page Development**
   - Implemented a **Navbar** for page navigation.
   - Added a **Hero Section** for introduction.
   - Designed a **Categories Section** using Bootstrap grid.
   - Built a **Popular Courses Carousel**:
     - Desktop → 4 courses per slide  
     - Mobile → 1 course per slide
   - Added **course badges** and **Add to Cart** buttons.
   - Completed with a clean **Footer**.

4. **About Page Development**
   - Added company/institution description.
   - Highlighted **mission, vision, and purpose**.
   - Introduced **key instructors** via Bootstrap cards.

5. **Contact Page Development**
   - Created a **working contact form** using Bootstrap form controls.
   - Displayed **email, location, and support details**.

6. **Styling and Responsiveness**
   - Adjusted spacing, colors, and typography using `style.css`.
   - Applied Bootstrap utility classes (`p-3`, `mb-4`, `shadow-sm`, etc.).
   - Ensured responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

7. **Version Control and Hosting**
   - Initialized Git repository and pushed project to GitHub.
   - Hosted the website using **GitHub Pages** for live preview.
