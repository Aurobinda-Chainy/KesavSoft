📝 Reflection Report – Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Web Page Design
Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Internship Task – Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Page Design.
The goal was to explore Bootstrap 5 components, understand layout structures, and remix them into visually clean and responsive web pages.

I created EduCourses, a multi-page educational website that showcases course categories, popular course listings, instructor details, and a contact form.
The project focused on UI/UX presentation, responsiveness, and component integration.

✅ Steps I Followed
1. Project Setup

Created the project folder structure:

index.html, about.html, contact.html, login.html, signup.html
css/style.css
images/


Included Bootstrap 5 CDN, Bootstrap Icons, and a custom stylesheet for additional styling.

2. Component Exploration

Explored the official Bootstrap documentation and Bootstrap Examples.

Identified reusable UI patterns such as:

Navbar

Cards

Carousel

Forms

Grid layout

Footer

3. Home Page Development

Designed a Hero Section with heading, description, and button.

Added Course Categories using Bootstrap grid and card components.

Implemented Popular Courses using:

A 4-card carousel for desktop

A single-card carousel for mobile (responsive UI).

Ensured layout uniformity through spacing and alignment utilities.

4. About Page Development

Added sections for:

Mission & Vision (with icons)

Instructor profiles (cards + hover social icons)

Website statistics (using Bootstrap icon + text blocks)

5. Contact Page Development

Created a functional contact form with input validation.

Displayed contact details using card layout.

Embedded Google Maps to show a location visually.

6. Styling & Responsiveness

Customized card hover effects, button spacing, and icons in style.css.

Used Bootstrap grid breakpoints (col-md-*, d-md-none, etc.) to ensure proper layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

7. Version Control & Deployment

Initialized Git, added and committed all files.

Pushed project to GitHub repository.

Deployed website using GitHub Pages.
